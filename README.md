This sample shows you how to integrate GraphQL into Spring Boot.

If you are starting up the service it is running under <http://localhost:8080> and the following GraphQL specific endpoints are available:

*   <http://localhost:8080/graphql> houses the endpoint the GraphQL schema is mapped to allow you to execute the queries, mutations, subscriptions.
*   <http://localhost:8080/graphiql> houses a little UI allowing you to play with what is defined in the schema (it in fact uses the /graphql endpoint).
